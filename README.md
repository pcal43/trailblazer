# Trailblazer

Trailblazer is a Fabric minecraft mod that changes blocks as they are walked on by players and mobs.

By default, the mod enables two trailblazing effects:

* **Dirt Trails.**  As players and zombies walk on grass blocks, the grass will change to dirt and then to paths...*unless* you're going barefoot or wearing boots enchanted with Feather Falling.

* **Firewalker Boots.**  If you're wearing Netherite Boots enchanted with Fire Protection and Frost Walker, Lava blocks will change to cobblestone as you walk on them.

## Features
* Does NOT add any new blocks to your world.  
* Does NOT have to be installed on the client
* Fully customizable.  Change the default effects or create your own.
* Mobs and players can leave trails
* Trails can be enabled or disabled depending on boots/enchants being worn
* Change any block to any other block
* Can work with boots and enchants from any other mod.
