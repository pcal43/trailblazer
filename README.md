# Trailblazer

Trailblazer is a Fabric minecraft mod that changes blocks as they are walked on.  

By default, the mod enables two trailblazing effects:

**Dirt Trails.**  As players and zombies walk on grass blocks, the grass will change to dirt and then to paths - *unless* you're going barefoot or wearing boots with Feather Falling.

**Firewalker Boots.**  If you're wearing Netherite Boots enchanted with Fire Protection and Frost Walker, Lava blocks will change to cobblestone as you walk on them.
 
 
These effects are fully customizable - you can modify them or even create brand new effects.
